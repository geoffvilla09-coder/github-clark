      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

      <p>
        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of 
        <span class="highlight">Nature</span>, 
        <span class="highlight">New Scientist</span>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, 
        was a well-thumbed copy of <span class="highlight">On The Road</span>. 
        It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that 
        <span class="highlight">“Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.”</span> 
        Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, 
        to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.
